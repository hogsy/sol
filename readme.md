# Sol

This is a fork of KMQuake2 being used in the development of Sol.
If you're looking for an actively maintained source port for Quake 2, this isn't what you're looking for; I recommend either checking out [KMQuake2](https://www.markshan.com/knightmare/), or others.

## What's Sol?

Sol is an experiment being developed using the Quake 2 engine. I'm not really ready to say much more at this stage, but if you're interested in helping out, for some reason, then feel free to get in touch.

## Credits

- Mark "hogsy" S. (Programmer)

### Additional

Huge thanks to everyone involved with KMQuake2 from which this project is being derived from.
