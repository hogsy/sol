# Sol 🌞

This is a fork of KMQuake2 being used in the development of Sol.
If you're looking for an actively maintained source port for Quake 2, this isn't what you're looking for; I recommend either checking out [KMQuake2](https://www.markshan.com/knightmare/), or others, such as [Yamagi Quake II](https://www.yamagi.org/quake2/).

## What's Sol? 🤔

Sol is an experiment being developed using the Quake 2 engine. I'm not really ready to say much more at this stage, but if you're interested in helping out, for some reason, then feel free to get in touch.

## Status 🔍

Right now I'm in the process of gutting and overhauling things.
Don't expect anything to work. It's probably not going to build under Windows for now either, as I'm primarily working under a Linux environment, though I'll set up some automation later to make sure it builds across multiple targets, and continues to do so.

At some stage I'll make a Trello board public where you can follow progress, but for now it's probably too early for that.

## Credits 📖

- Mark "hogsy" S. (Programmer)

### Additional
