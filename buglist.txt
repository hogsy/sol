vertex lights become dark after map transition (vid_restart fixes)
	- FIXED, caused by allocating 0x800000 max size for md2 models
	
crash on darksun1.bsp when vertexlight/vertexlightbase fields not properly allocated (Hunk_Alloc problem?)
	- FIXED, caused by allocating same size for each poly in a surface

crashes when loading a game that has a target_text box open
	- FIXED by clearing textdisplay pointer in each client struct during load process

skin name the same as player model name duplicated in skin display list
	- FIXED with better filename checking
	
2D disappearing when in 3rd person mode w/ projection shadows
	- FIXED by clearing z coordinate in vertex array	
	
drops to console (SV_DemoCompleted, SV_Nextserver called twice) when changing from demo to normal map in a nextserver sequence (Belly of the Beast, SOG)
	- FIXED by clearing sv.demofile file handle in SV_DemoCompleted

models with bad skinnums rendered as invisible (0 alpha?)
	- FIXED by checking skinnum before assgning renderparms

alpha test textures not displaying properly on ATI cards (lightmap blended into alpha channel?)
	- FIXED by setting alpha in lightmap to 255

memory leak on vid_restart / map change
	- FIXED by freeing JPG file buffer
	
no audio in Q2 intermission cinematics
	- FIXED by better order-of-operations handling in snd_dma.c->S_RawSamples
	
plats with spawnflag PLAT_LOW_TRIGGER breaking with high lip value set
	- FIXED by setting tmin[2] differently for this spawnflag
	
door and plat looped sounds can get stuck on when blocked by a monster
	- FIXED by clearing looped sound for all cases in door_hit_top()/door_hit_bottom() and plat_hit_top()/plat_hit_bottom()
	
fatal error when loading too many md2 models (VirtualAlloc reserve failure)
	- FIXED by implementing new ModChunk_ memory allocation system for models
	
game menu text doesn't show when connected to RA2 server
	- FIXED by allowing CS_STATUSBAR to overflow thru CS_AIRACCEL-1
	
Crucified insane in jail4 moving downward when player is shot by blaster guard.
	Causes startsolid error for key_security_pass spawned by target_spawner in air above floor.
	This is due to insane's earlier death by crusher, spawning key_security_pass when crusher overlaps its bbox.
	- FIXED by using moreflags edict_t field for internal crucified checks

Thirdperson player shadow not drawn correctly at times (start of hangar1)

Acebot dead bodies have interpolation glitch on respawn
	- FIXED by setting oldorigin in ACESP_PutClientInServer()

invalid player models causing crashes?
	- likely caused by corrupt or missing player models

Filelists not downloading all pak files (brazen)
	- FIXED by preventing HTTP download of the first pak in a filelist from aborting other paks

Maps.lst on disk override same filename inside pak?	
	- FIXED by adding check against tryExtFirst files in FS_FileInPakBlacklist(), then testing for local file on disk

Text color codes not handled properly by Con_Print()?
	- FIXED by adding formatting tracking for console line feed

Endless HTTP downloading loops with 24-bit texture downloading enabled
	- FIXED by replacing erroneous "precache_check < CS_IMAGES+max_images" check with "precache_check < cs_images+max_images"
