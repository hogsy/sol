------------------------------
How To Run
------------------------------
	Unzip into your Quake2 directory (where quake2.exe is) and make a shortcut with path

	x\quake2\kmquake2.exe +set game gamedir (for singleplayer, LAN games, and net client use)

	where X is your Quake2 dir's parent dir (for example, C: or D:\games), and gamedir
	is the game subdirectory (if any) where the mod you want to run is.  NOTE: for the
	mod's code to run, it must be compiled into a kmq2gamex86.dll (see end of file for
	instructions).

	To mount assets from the mission packs for use with any mod, add
	
	+set basegame missionpackdir
	
	You can have up to 3 basegames set:
	
	+set basegame xatrix +set basegame2 rogue +set basegame3 zaero

	To mount assets from the Steam re-release version of Quake1 using a pak remap script (see kmq2_misc_scripting.txt), add 
	
	+set quakerr_importpath_auto 1
	
	For the original Steam version, add
	
	+set quake_importpath_auto 1
	
	For non-Steam versions of Quake1, add
	
	+set quake_importpath X:\Quake
	
	Where X:\Quake is the Quake1 install path.
	
	You can also mount up to 4 Quake1 mission packs or mods in addition to the id1 folder:
	
	+set quakegame1 hipnotic +set quakegame2 rogue +set quakegame3 nehahra +set quakegame4 ad

	To ensure connection to all standard Quake2 protocol (34) servers, add
	
	+set cl_servertrick 1
	
	to the command line.  Or you can set the "client protocol compatbility" option in the Join Server menu
	to version 34 (stock Quake2).  This is disabled by default.
	
	If you want to enable the playing of cinematics off the game or mission pack CD, add

	+set scanforcd 1

	to the command line.  This is disabled by default.
	
	If you are launching KMQuake2 from the Steam interface, you can move the included quake2.exe (or quake2_x64.exe)
	launcher in the steam_wrapper folder into the Quake2 install folder alongside kmquake2.exe.
	This is a better method than renaming kmquake2.exe to quake2.exe.

	KMQuake2 writes/reads savegames, config files, demos, etc. to <userprofile>/Saved Games/KMQuake2 on Windows Vista
	and later, and to My Documents/My Games/KMQuake2 on Windows 2000/XP/2003.
	Auto-downloaded files are saved to <userprofile>/Downloads/KMQuake2 on Windows Vista and later, and
	My Documents/My Downloads/KMQuake2 on Windows 2000/XP/2003.
	
	The classic Quake 2 behavior of writing config files/savegames/etc to the Quake2 folder can be restored by adding the parameter
	"-portable" to the command line, or by placing an empty text file called "portable.cfg" in the baseq2 folder.

	If it crashes on startup, make sure that kmq2gamex86.dll is in the baseq2 folder.

	If the controls are missing in the menus and particle effects don't appear properly,
	make sure that kmquake2.pk3 is in the baseq2 folder.

	If you experience lockups on an ATI video card, set entity shell type to solid or flowing
	in the advanced section of the video menu.  The envmap effect may be causing the lockups.

	If performance is too slow, or there are no visible or all black textures, type
	"exec lowend.cfg; vid_restart" in the console.  If you still get all-black
	textures, remove all config files from the game and savegame directories you are running in and restart.
	This will make KMQ2 fall back on the internal cvar defaults.

	It is strongly recommened that you copy the idlog.cin file from the Quake2 CD to your
	baseq2/video folder.  This will allow you to always open the menu before any demos start playing.
	
	To hear Ogg Vorbis tracks ingame, rip the Q2 CD's audio tracks (2-11) to track02-track11.ogg
	and put them in baseq2/music.  For the mission pack audio tracks, rip the Ground Zero CD's
	audio tracks (2-11) to track12-track21.ogg.  Don't bother ripping the tracks from the
	Reckoning CD, as they're a mix of the tracks on the Q2 and Ground Zero CDs.  Everything else
	will be taken care of internally by KMQuake2.

			MOD SUPPORT INSTRUCTIONS

=====================================================================================

To compile your mod for KMQuake2, substitute the files game/q_shared.c, game/q_shared.h,
and game/game.h from the engine's source code into the mod's source after backing up the mod's originals.
Or you can just search for all my changes, which are marked with my name, if you don't want to use
GPLed headers.  Just don't forget to include the #ifdef compiler directives around my changes.
Some mods may make additions or changes to these 3 files, so in that case you will need to use
a diff utility like Windiff to find said changes and hand-merge them into the files from
KMQ2's source.

Next, in g_save.c, change the assignment of the "maxentities" cvar from this:

maxentities = gi.cvar ("maxentities", "1024", CVAR_LATCH);

to this:

maxentities = gi.cvar ("maxentities", va("%i",MAX_EDICTS), CVAR_LATCH);

Then, change all references to modelindex 255 to MAX_MODELS-1 (for most mods,
p_client.c, p_view.c, and p_weapon.c are the only files that need changes).

Before compiling, make sure that this line in q_shared.h is uncommented:

#define	KMQUAKE2_ENGINE_MOD

You can revert your mod to compatibility with other engines by commenting out this line.

Finally, after compiling, rename the resulting gamex86.dll to kmq2gamex86.dll so
that the new engine will load it (don't overwrite your existing game DLL!).
